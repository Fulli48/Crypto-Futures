SINGLE BLOCK INSTRUCTION FOR ROBUST DATA/LEARNING SYSTEM CONNECTION:

Create a fully integrated, resilient data flow and feedback architecture that seamlessly connects the trade signal generation module, the chart/feature database, and the new learning/meta-model subsystem, ensuring real-time data exchange, traceability, retraining, and reliability. The solution must guarantee every trade decision, signal, and outcome is properly captured, accessible, and usable for ongoing model learning and system health monitoring. Implement the following, step by step:

Unified Data Schema and ID System

Define a master data schema for trade signals, trades, features, forecasts, and outcomes.

Every trade suggestion and trade must have a unique, time-based signal_id and, if executed, a trade_id.

Store: symbol, timestamp, input feature vector (raw and normalized), model forecasts, technical indicators, all filter/consensus flags, risk/reward, ensemble dispersion, meta-model prediction, confidence score, all intermediate calculations, and final suggestion (LONG/SHORT/WAIT).

For trades: store fill details, execution timestamps, actual entry/exit prices, all realized P&L and risk stats, and final trade status.

Ensure all objects across databases are linked by signal_id (and trade_id if executed).

Atomic Signal Generation and Logging

When a signal is generated, atomically write the full signal object and all inputs/outputs to the database (transaction-safe; never partial writes).

Use a dedicated “signals” table/collection for every generated signal, even WAIT/filtered-out ones.

For each entry, include a field for the full normalized feature window and any additional derived features used by the learning/meta-model system.

Feature/Chart Database Synchronization

For each signal, store a reference or copy of the relevant window from the feature/chart database that was used for its calculation.

Ensure synchronization: signal’s input features must always match the database snapshot at that timestamp. Log a checksum/hash of the input array for auditability.

Trade Execution and Realized Outcome Recording

When a trade is executed, record the trade_id linked to the originating signal_id, storing all real execution details (timestamp, prices, position size, slippage, fee, etc).

As each trade progresses, log minute-by-minute P&L, drawdown, and live risk stats until trade exit (TP, SL, timeout).

At close, store the realized outcome, final P&L, and all end-of-trade stats in an “outcomes” table, always cross-linked to signal_id and trade_id.

Learning/Meta-Model Data Pipeline

Set up a robust ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) that, at regular intervals (e.g., every hour), aggregates all new signals, trades, and outcomes into a “learning dataset” for the meta-model system.

For each row in this dataset, include:

Input features, technicals, all ensemble/model outputs, confidence and dispersion scores, filter decisions, meta-model prediction (at time of trade), outcome labels (profit, loss, drawdown, time to target), all trade/market context features (volatility, volume, liquidity, etc), and timestamp.

Write this data in a versioned, append-only log or database table for full auditability and rollback.

Meta-Model Training and Model Registry

The meta-model worker must automatically read the latest learning dataset, retrain (on a sliding or expanding window), and evaluate the new model on the most recent N trades for accuracy, calibration, and risk.

Store the new meta-model artifact in a versioned model registry, with metadata: training interval, features used, performance metrics, timestamp, and hash of training data.

Upon validation, atomically promote the new model to “production” for live inference, always logging the version in use for every new signal.

Real-Time Meta-Model Inference

On every new signal, the signal generation module must call the latest “production” meta-model, passing the full feature set (as used during training) and all ensemble/model outputs and flags, to get the live win-probability/confidence.

Store the meta-model’s output with each signal record, so every trade has the model version and score as actually used.

Error Handling and Self-Healing

If any part of the system (signal gen, database write, meta-model inference, trade logging) fails, queue the data and retry persistently until successful, logging all error events.

Any uncaught exception, data corruption, or mismatch (e.g., input features do not match database at signal time, missing outcome data for a closed trade, etc) should trigger an alert and detailed error report.

Implement regular self-checks (e.g., every 10 minutes): verify signal-trade-outcome chain integrity, orphaned records, or missing data, and auto-trigger backfill or recovery scripts as needed.

Traceability, Rollback, and Audit

For every signal and trade, enable end-to-end traceability:

From chart data → features → signal → trade → outcome → meta-model update, all records must be directly linkable by signal_id (and trade_id).

Log every schema change, data transform, and model retrain event with version and timestamp.

All writes should be atomic, and each object should be immutable once written except for post-trade outcome fields.

Extensibility and Security

Document every data schema, ETL step, and model registry field in a persistent, easily accessible format (README, schema files, or database documentation table).

Structure the code so new features, models, or filter logic can be added with minimal changes and clearly versioned.

Secure all data with user authentication, access logs, and backup scripts, ensuring no data loss or unauthorized access is possible.

Important data fields per record (at minimum):

signal_id, trade_id, symbol, timestamp

raw/normalized input features (full rolling window)

technicals, model/ensemble outputs, filter flags, consensus/dispersion stats

risk/reward, position size, stop-loss/take-profit/entry

meta-model prediction and version, signal quality score, warnings

trade execution details (fill, size, P&L, slippage, fees, timing)

final trade outcome (profit/loss, exit reason, max drawdown, realized volatility)

audit/version metadata (all transformations and timestamps)

Result:
This architecture guarantees every signal, trade, and outcome is persistently and atomically stored, perfectly linked to its full feature and model context, and immediately available for meta-model retraining, evaluation, and audit. The system will never lose, mis-link, or mislabel data; all failures are logged and recoverable; every trade is fully explainable and traceable; and future learning, analysis, and debugging are simple and robust.
