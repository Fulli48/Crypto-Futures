### Handling Undertrained ML Engine â€“ Failsafe Solution

1. **Detect Insufficient Training:**
   - Before generating or displaying trade signals, check these conditions:
     - The total number of completed, fully analyzed trades is less than a safe threshold (suggested: 50 or 100).
     - OR the moving average confidence of all predictions is below a minimal viable threshold (suggested: 35%).

   - Example check:
     ```js
     const minTradeHistory = 50;
     const minConfidenceLevel = 35;
     const isUndertrained = (
       this.performanceMetrics.completedTradeCount < minTradeHistory ||
       mean(this.performanceMetrics.recentConfidences) < minConfidenceLevel
     );
     ```

2. **Adaptive Failsafe:**
   - If undertrained, do NOT generate or display real trades/simulations.
   - Instead, return a "no-trade" status and show an explanatory message.

   - Example action:
     ```js
     if (isUndertrained) {
       // Block creation/display of trade signals
       return {
         signals: [],
         status: 'undertrained',
         message: 'The AI needs more trade data to confidently generate signals. As more trade outcomes are collected, the system will begin producing actionable trade opportunities.'
       };
     }
     ```

3. **Simulation Mode Option (Optional):**
   - If desired, allow an "exploratory simulation mode" using default/static model weights with a clear warning:
     - "Simulations are for demonstration only until the AI has learned from enough real trades."

4. **UI Feedback:**
   - In the app, if `status === 'undertrained'`, display:
     - "Training in progress: The AI is learning from real trades. Trade signals will appear once the system is confident enough to provide high-quality suggestions. Check back soon!"

5. **Automatic Transition:**
   - Once the trade count and/or average confidence pass the minimums, the normal signal generation resumes automatically.

**Summary:**  
Before creating or showing trades, always check if the ML engine is trained enough. If not, block trade creation and display a clear, encouraging message. Optionally, enable a simulation-only/demo mode with an appropriate warning. Resume normal operation automatically when enough data is available.
