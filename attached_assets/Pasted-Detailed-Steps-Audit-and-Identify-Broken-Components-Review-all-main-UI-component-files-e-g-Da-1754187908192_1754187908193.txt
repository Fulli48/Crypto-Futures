Detailed Steps:

Audit and Identify Broken Components:

Review all main UI component files (e.g., Dashboard.jsx, App.jsx, related components in /components).

Check for recent accidental deletions, overwritten code, or unresolved merge conflicts.

Reference Working Design:

Use the provided screenshot as the reference for structure, section titles, metrics, buttons, and overall layout.

Document the correct order of all sections, including headings, stats, tab/group layouts, and any conditional rendering.

Manual Reconstruction Procedure:

For every main section visible in the screenshot (e.g., “Expected Profit Strength,” “Rolling 500-Trade Window,” “AI Trade Suggestions,” “Dynamic Live ML System,” “Live Learning System”), reconstruct or repair the JSX code and ensure:

The correct component structure and hierarchy is in place.

All buttons (e.g., “View Chart Data,” “Learning System,” “Generate New Suggestions”) are present and properly labeled.

Stat and metric displays are arranged in grids or flex layouts to match the screenshot.

Tab or group components for “Live Generation,” “Pending Suggestions,” etc. are in the right order.

Restore all CSS or styling logic:

Check Dashboard.module.css, App.css, global styles, and component-specific styles for accidental changes or removals.

Re-add missing classnames or style rules based on the design in the screenshot.

Reconnect all props/state/data:

Make sure metrics (system confidence, tracked symbols, active models, learning status, etc.) are correctly fetched and displayed.

Fix any broken hooks or data mapping.

Testing and Verification:

After reconstructing, run the UI in preview.

Verify every section matches the screenshot—position, label, style, color, and visibility.

Test all UI controls (tabs, buttons, expandable groups) to ensure they show the correct content and are interactive.

Console Error Check:

Open the developer console in Replit preview and fix any rendering or runtime errors related to the dashboard components.

Final Backup and Documentation:

Once restored, save a local backup of the fixed files for safety.

Optionally, document the main component structure for future fast recovery.
