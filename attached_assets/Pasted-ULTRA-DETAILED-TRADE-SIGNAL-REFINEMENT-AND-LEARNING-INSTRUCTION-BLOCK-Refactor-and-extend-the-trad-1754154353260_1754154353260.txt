ULTRA-DETAILED TRADE SIGNAL REFINEMENT AND LEARNING INSTRUCTION BLOCK:

Refactor and extend the trade suggestion module to maximize accuracy, minimize false positives, and enable continuous learning by implementing the following expert-level signal filtering, adaptive consensus, risk control, and self-improvement logic for every coin, on every forecast cycle:

Ensemble Model and Dispersion Validation:

For each coin, at each minute, aggregate all 20-minute forecasts from all trained models (LSTM, GRU/TCN, XGBoost, baseline/statistical).

For each predicted minute, compute the standard deviation and range (“dispersion”) of model forecasts.

Require ensemble consensus (mean absolute dispersion) for every forecast minute to be below a dynamic threshold, set as 1× the rolling 20-minute volatility for that coin.

If the threshold is breached at any point, set signal to WAIT and log “model disagreement.”

Dynamic, Volatility-Scaled Signal Thresholds:

For every forecast cycle, dynamically calculate the minimum required forecasted move as 1.2× the rolling 20-minute standard deviation of returns (rounded up to nearest 0.05%).

Only allow trade signals if forecasted move (abs(f20 – current_price) / current_price) exceeds this value and is larger than the sum of round-trip fees plus 1× average slippage.

Otherwise, set signal to WAIT and log “insufficient expected move.”

Path Consistency and Smoothness Filter:

Ensure at least 85% of steps in the 20-min forecast path are monotonic in trade direction.

If forecast “chops” direction (up/down flips >3× in the path), treat as indecisive and set to WAIT.

Technical Indicator Multi-Check:

For LONG: require RSI 40–70 trending up (last 5 min), MACD positive and above signal, Stoch K > Stoch D > 40, and price above 20-min MA or breaking BB upper band.

For SHORT: require RSI 30–60 trending down, MACD negative/below signal, Stoch K < Stoch D < 60, price below MA or breaking BB lower band.

Any conflicting indicator triggers a warning and reduces confidence by 25%. Two or more conflicts = WAIT.

Risk/Reward and Trade Quality Enforcement:

Calculate reward/risk ratio (TP–entry)/(entry–SL), require ≥2.0 net of fees and slippage.

Position size must risk ≤0.5% of account per trade.

If constraints can’t be met, set signal to WAIT and log reason.

Order Book and Liquidity Checks:

For each trade, verify average volume and book depth over the last 10 minutes is at least 5× the needed position size.

If not, downsize or set to WAIT (“liquidity insufficient”).

Cross-Market Consensus Filter:

Check highly correlated coins’ forecasts.

If >50% of correlated assets disagree, reduce confidence by 30%. If all disagree, WAIT.

All agree = boost confidence 10%.

Volatility and News Spike Detection:

Suppress trades for 2–5 minutes after detecting volume or price spikes >3× rolling ATR.

Log all such events for review.

Meta-Model Learning Layer (Continuous Learning):

Create a secondary classifier (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost, or simple neural net) trained on historical trade signal outcomes, using as features:

Model ensemble agreement metrics,

Forecast move size,

Path smoothness,

Technical confirmations,

Risk/reward,

Cross-market alignment,

Recent volatility,

Liquidity/volume features,

Any prior warnings or overrides.

Train this meta-model to predict the real-time probability that a proposed trade suggestion will be profitable (net of fees and slippage) over the next 20 minutes.

After each trade closes (TP, SL, or timeout), record the outcome (profit/loss, max drawdown, slippage, etc) and all features for retraining.

Retrain and update the meta-model regularly (hourly or daily, as data allows), and adjust the “issue trade” decision threshold dynamically based on rolling live hit rate (e.g., only issue trades if meta-model predicts ≥65% probability of profit in current regime).

Signal Quality Scoring and UI Transparency:

Calculate a composite signal quality score as:

Model agreement (30%),

Technical confluence (25%),

Risk/reward (20%),

Cross-market consensus (15%),

Meta-model win probability (10%).

Color code signals:

90–100%: green

70–89%: blue

50–69%: yellow

<50%: WAIT

Display contributing factors, meta-model output, and all warnings on each suggestion card for operator and audit review.

Trade Logging, Outcome Tracking, and Feedback:

Log for every signal and trade:

All input features, forecast vectors, technicals, meta-model score, warnings, and the final suggestion reason.

The exact trade result: entry/exit, P&L, max drawdown, time to target, slippage, and realized fees.

Aggregate these results to produce rolling hit rates, win/loss distributions, and realized vs. forecasted outcome scatterplots.

Use these stats to auto-adjust model weights, signal thresholds, and meta-model calibration at least daily.

Fail-Safe and Conservative Defaults:

Default to WAIT if any core filter, consensus, technical check, risk, liquidity, or meta-model win probability fails.

Log the precise failure reason and suggestion suppression for transparency and future improvement.

Adaptive Parameter and Filter Learning:

Continuously monitor live hit rate, realized drawdowns, and system alpha.

If hit rate or risk metrics fall below pre-set minimums (e.g., win rate <55% or realized RR <1.2), auto-tighten signal thresholds (raise move or confidence required), increase suppression of low-quality signals, and highlight underperforming models for retraining.

Allow all filter thresholds (e.g., required model agreement, minimum RR, minimum liquidity, etc) to be auto-adjusted based on rolling statistics, using Bayesian optimization or grid search on recent trade history to maximize live profitability.

Result:
Your trade signal engine will learn continuously from every trade, automatically adapting to market regimes and feedback, issuing only high-confidence, multi-model, technically-confirmed trades, with live calibration of all logic and parameters. All decisions, outcomes, warnings, and filter logic are logged for full transparency, auditability, and ongoing self-improvement.
