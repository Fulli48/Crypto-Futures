Here is a copy-paste prompt you can feed directly to your AI code assistant to implement your requirements for storing simulated trade data second by second, including both dynamic per-second data and static data points:

üìã Prompt for AI Coding Assistant: Second-by-Second Simulated Trade Data Storage

‚∏ª

For every simulated trade, implement a data structure and logic so that:

For each second of the simulation, store the following values:
	‚Ä¢	current_price: The asset price at that second
	‚Ä¢	profit_time: Cumulative time (in seconds) spent in profit up to this point in the trade
	‚Ä¢	profit_percent: Percentage of elapsed trade time that was spent in profit up to this point (profit_time / seconds_elapsed)
	‚Ä¢	loss_time: Cumulative time (in seconds) spent in loss up to this point
	‚Ä¢	loss_percent: Percentage of elapsed trade time that was spent in loss up to this point (loss_time / seconds_elapsed)
	‚Ä¢	highest_profit: The highest unrealized profit reached so far (difference between entry price and peak price, depending on LONG or SHORT)
	‚Ä¢	lowest_loss: The lowest (most negative) unrealized profit/loss reached so far (worst drawdown so far)

Store this per-second data in a list/array or similar structure for the entire duration of the simulated trade.

‚∏ª

For every simulation, store these static data points (the same for every second):
	‚Ä¢	take_profit: Take profit value set for the trade
	‚Ä¢	stop_loss: Stop loss value set for the trade
	‚Ä¢	entry_price: Entry price for the trade
	‚Ä¢	profit_chance: Algorithm‚Äôs predicted chance of this trade being profitable (as a %)
	‚Ä¢	trade_duration_type: The type of trade by duration (e.g., ‚Äú5min‚Äù, ‚Äú15min‚Äù, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	suggested_direction: Whether this was a suggested ‚ÄúLONG‚Äù or ‚ÄúSHORT‚Äù trade

Make sure all of these static values are easily accessible along with the per-second data.

Summary of Data Structure:

Each simulated trade should store:

{
  "static": {
    "take_profit": ...,
    "stop_loss": ...,
    "entry_price": ...,
    "profit_chance": ...,
    "trade_duration_type": ...,
    "suggested_direction": ...,
  },
  "per_second": [
    {
      "second": ...,
      "current_price": ...,
      "profit_time": ...,
      "profit_percent": ...,
      "loss_time": ...,
      "loss_percent": ...,
      "highest_profit": ...,
      "lowest_loss": ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}


‚∏ª

Additional Implementation Instructions:
	‚Ä¢	Update profit_time and loss_time counters every second depending on whether the trade would be in profit or loss at that moment (for the direction of the trade).
	‚Ä¢	Update highest_profit and lowest_loss at every second based on the best/worst unrealized outcome up to that point.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all data is recorded even if the trade closes early (TP/SL hit).
