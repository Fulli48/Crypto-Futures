Update the trade completion and failure logic to better reflect realistic user experience. Implement the following logic everywhere trades are evaluated:
	1.	For each simulated trade, track price action at each interval (preferably minute-by-minute) during the 20-minute window.
	2.	For LONG trades:

	•	If price >= takeProfit at any interval, actualOutcome = “TP_HIT”
	•	If price <= stopLoss at any interval, actualOutcome = “SL_HIT”
	•	Otherwise, count how many intervals price >= entryPrice * (1 + MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD), where MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD is 0.001 (0.1%)
	•	If the trade spends at least MIN_PROFIT_TIME (set MIN_PROFIT_TIME = 2 minutes) above this profit threshold, actualOutcome = “PULLOUT_PROFIT”
	•	If not, actualOutcome = “NO_PROFIT”

	3.	For SHORT trades:

	•	If price <= takeProfit at any interval, actualOutcome = “TP_HIT”
	•	If price >= stopLoss at any interval, actualOutcome = “SL_HIT”
	•	Otherwise, count how many intervals price <= entryPrice * (1 - MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD)
	•	If trade spends at least MIN_PROFIT_TIME (2 minutes) below this profit threshold, actualOutcome = “PULLOUT_PROFIT”
	•	If not, actualOutcome = “NO_PROFIT”

	4.	Set these configuration constants at the top of your trade evaluation module:

	•	MIN_PROFIT_TIME = 2 // minutes (comfortable window for pullout opportunity)
	•	MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD = 0.001 // 0.1% profit

	5.	For reporting and dashboard stats:

	•	Success = TP_HIT + PULLOUT_PROFIT
	•	Failure = SL_HIT + NO_PROFIT
	•	Failure rate = (Failures) / (Total Completed Trades) * 100

	6.	Update all simulation, evaluation, and dashboard logic to use these outcomes and definitions.
	7.	Example implementation:
const MIN_PROFIT_TIME = 2; // minutes
const MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD = 0.001; // 0.1% profit

for each trade:
let profitIntervals = 0;
for each minute in the 20-minute window:
if trade is LONG:
if price >= takeProfit: outcome = “TP_HIT”; break;
if price <= stopLoss: outcome = “SL_HIT”; break;
if price >= entryPrice * (1 + MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD): profitIntervals += 1;
if trade is SHORT:
if price <= takeProfit: outcome = “TP_HIT”; break;
if price >= stopLoss: outcome = “SL_HIT”; break;
if price <= entryPrice * (1 - MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD): profitIntervals += 1;
if not outcome:
if profitIntervals >= MIN_PROFIT_TIME: outcome = “PULLOUT_PROFIT”;
else outcome = “NO_PROFIT”;

Update all code and analytics to use these new outcome definitions and verify results against real historical data.
