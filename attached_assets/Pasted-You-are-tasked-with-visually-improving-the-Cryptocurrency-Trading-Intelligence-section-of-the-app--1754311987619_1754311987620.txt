You are tasked with visually improving the "Cryptocurrency Trading Intelligence" section of the app. Apply the following changes precisely:

1. Merge the title, subtitle, and stats into a single connected section styled as one cohesive block with a dark background, smooth border-radius, and soft box-shadow. Do not separate the header and stat cards.

2. Center the heading "Cryptocurrency Trading Intelligence" and its subtext horizontally within the block. Ensure vertical spacing between the heading and the stats is aesthetically balanced.

3. In the stats row, place the brain emoji icon (ðŸ§ ) exactly centered horizontally between the two stat blocks: "Expected Profit Strength" and "Trade Failure Rate". Make sure this is visually balanced and symmetrical on all screen sizes.

4. Each stat block should include:
   - A bold numeric value (e.g., "0.0%") with red for "Profit Strength" and green for "Failure Rate"
   - A bold title beneath it, split into two lines
   - A smaller description beneath the title, with muted text color

5. Below the stat row, include two gradient-glow pill-shaped buttons: "ðŸ“Š View Chart Data" and "âš¡ Learning System". Stack or wrap them responsively for mobile.

6. Use the following style rules:
   - `.intelligence-container`: dark background (#0f111b), border-radius: 16px, max-width: 800px, centered with padding: 2rem, soft box-shadow
   - `.header-section h1`: font-size: 1.8rem, color: #5c8aff, centered
   - `.subtext`: color: #90a4d4, font-size: 1rem
   - `.stats-section`: flex row with two stat cards and a centered brain icon, gap: 1rem, wrap on mobile
   - `.stat-card`: background-color: #1a1d2e, border-radius: 10px, inset glow, text-align: center
   - `.stat-value`: font-size: 2rem, bold, red (#ff4c4c) or green (#00dd80)
   - `.stat-title`: bold, line-break allowed
   - `.stat-desc`: font-size: 0.8rem, color: #a8b3d9
   - `.brain-icon`: font-size: 2rem, centered, color: #ccccff
   - `.button-row button`: gradient background (#4a00e0 to #8e2de2), white text, border-radius: 50px, hover glow, responsive

7. Make it fully mobile-responsive using media queries. On screens <600px, stack the stat blocks and buttons vertically.

8. Implement this entire section as a single reusable React component or HTML/CSS block depending on the project structure.

Once complete, replace the current disjointed header + stats layout with this redesigned structure.
