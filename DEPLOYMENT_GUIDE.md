2. **Choose "Production" deployment**
3. **Configure your deployment:**

## Option 2: Download and Self-Host

### What You Get:
The built files are ready in the `dist` folder:
- `dist/index.js` - Your server code
- `dist/public/` - Your frontend assets

### Requirements for Self-Hosting:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A hosting service (VPS, cloud provider, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of server deployment

### Steps to Self-Host:
1. Download this entire project
2. Copy the `dist` folder to your server
3. Install production dependencies: `npm install --production`
4. Set environment variables if using database
5. Run: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
6. Use a process manager like PM2 for production
7. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) for HTTPS

## Option 3: Deploy to Cloud Platforms

### Supported Platforms:
- **Heroku**: Add a `Procfile` with `web: node dist/index.js`
- **Vercel**: May need adjustments for server-side code

- **Render**: Free tier available with automatic deploys

## Environment Variables

If you plan to use a database in production, set:
