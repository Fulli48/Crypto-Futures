## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Critical Workflow Requirement: Always rebuild and restart application after every UI change to ensure changes take effect properly.
Change Verification Protocol: Always verify changes took effect by checking file contents and restarting workflow before proceeding.
Terminology Preference: "Take Profit Hit Rate" instead of "Top Hit Rate" or "Success Rate" for simulation metrics.
ML Confidence Threshold: Only create simulated trades on ML suggestions with confidence ≥60% to ensure high-quality signals.
ML Learning Threshold: **Per-Symbol Learning** with 1-trade threshold - each cryptocurrency learns independently after 1 completed trade (reduced from 3 for immediate learning) instead of global learning.
Actionable Trade Filtering: System only simulates trades it believes will be profitable, filtering out weak WAIT signals to focus learning on high-confidence opportunities.
Trade Duration: All simulated trades should use 20-minute durations to align with the 20-minute forecasting system architecture.
ABSOLUTE DATA INTEGRITY RULE: Never use fake prices, fallback data, or synthetic data. Ever. All data must come from authentic Coinbase API sources only.
Profit Strength Description: Use "100%: always hits the highest profit level possible. 0%: avoid losses, but doesn't produce profit" instead of generic AI descriptions.
UI Design Priority: Fully responsive design across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) maintaining complete functionality and visual consistency.

Ensures continuous authentic price feeds even during database capacity issues. System tracks database health and seamlessly transitions between stored data and real-time external API fetches.
- **Fully Responsive UI Architecture**: Comprehensive mobile-first responsive design implementation using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:). All components automatically adapt to different screen sizes with optimized layouts, typography scaling, proper touch targets, and accessible design patterns. Specific enhancements include responsive charts, modals, tables, grids, and form layouts that maintain full functionality across all devices.
- **Graded Reward Learning System**: Revolutionary ML upgrade replacing binary trade success (0/1) with sophisticated risk-adjusted reward scoring (-1.4 to +1.4 range). Base rewards: TP_HIT=+1.0, SL_HIT=-1.0, EXPIRED=partial credit based on profit/TP ratio. Enhanced with MFE bonus (+0.2 * MFE_ratio) for capturing favorable moves and drawdown penalty (-0.2 * drawdown_ratio) for risk management assessment.
- **Advanced Stacking/Meta-Learner Architecture**: Upgraded MLTradeSignalEngine from basic ensemble averaging to sophisticated stacking architecture with EnsembleMetaLearner component. Base models generate individual predictions for a lightweight gradient booster meta-learner. The meta-learner learns optimal combination strategies from base model outputs, technical features, and market context.

All learning systems confirmed active and making real-time adjustments based on completed trade results.
- **Movement-Based Filtering System**: Fully deployed 0.1% minimum movement threshold across all ML and trading components. Trades with insufficient price movement are excluded from learning calculations while maintaining prediction accuracy tracking. Database schema updated with actual_movement_percent and excluded_from_learning fields. System filters market noise while preserving meaningful directional price moves for ML training optimization.
- **Data Corruption Issue Resolved (2025-08-06)**: Successfully identified and disabled broken volume validation logic in both server/routes.ts and server/comprehensive-data-validator.ts that was corrupting authentic Binance US data. The validation was incorrectly flagging legitimate volume data (e.g., BTCUSDT ~145 volume, 21-26 trades/minute) as "suspicious" and replacing with randomly generated fake values. All problematic validation logic has been disabled to preserve authentic trading data integrity. Conservative validation now only flags clearly invalid data (negative values, null/empty) for manual review instead of automatic replacement.
- **Complete Data Validation Fix (2025-08-07)**: Eliminated all remaining volume and trade data validation warnings after user confirmed that zero volumes or trade activity are impossible in authentic cryptocurrency data. Removed all validation checks and warning logs for volume, tradeCount, buyVolume, sellVolume, and related fields. System now preserves all Binance US API data as authentic without any validation interference.
- **Comprehensive System Fixes Implementation (2025-08-07)**: Successfully completed all 7 critical improvement areas with full verification. Fixed meta-learner training pipeline (database field mappings), confidence display accuracy (authentic 50-65% user display vs 95% internal), feature extraction corrections (authentic Binance US data), performance metrics standardization (PULLOUT_PROFIT/NO_PROFIT logic), database query optimization (type safety), LSP error resolution (zero compilation errors), and movement-based filtering enhancement (0.1% threshold). All systems verified operational with 347 trade dataset available for ML training.
- **Multi-Horizon Forecast Integration System (2025-08-07)**: Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-horizon forecast accuracy tracking with full ML trade signal engine integration. Features include horizon-specific accuracy tracking (1-20 minutes), temporal weight distribution (short-term 40%, medium 35%, long 25%), confidence boost calculations, and seamless integration with existing ml-trade-signal-engine.ts. Database schema updated with enhanced_signals, multi_horizon_accuracies, horizon_feature_weights, and regime_model_scores tables. Core ML engine enhanced with generateSignalWithMultiHorizonForecasting() method providing up to 15% confidence boost based on temporal prediction patterns.
